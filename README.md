# Only One LIGHT #

Hey, I made this game for the [GMTK Jam 2019](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2019/rate/462638).
You can also find the official site for this game [here on itch.io](https://sinistersnare.itch.io/only-one-light)!

You have a flashlight, and you must find the exit!


If you want to build this game yourself, please clone this repo (or download the source from itch), and then open it in Unity.

It is built with unity 2018.2, so use that if you want to be safe.
